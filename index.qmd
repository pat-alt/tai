## What's this?

On this website I plan to share resources - links to papers, talks, blog posts - that I have found useful when trying to navigate the Trustworthy AI landscape. I hope it will serve others who are interested in the field. At the moment I am not planning to use this site to showcase any of my own research, which can be found on my [homepage](https://www.paltmeyer.com/).

## Quarto

This is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) website that was built within just a few hours.

> QuartoÂ® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Quarto documents are authored using markdown, an easy to write plain text format.

Quarto is among the latest advancements brought to us by RStudio. It promises to offer a publishing system that is largely language agnostic. Among other things it comes with native support for both Jupyter and Knitr.
